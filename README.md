# landingpage_fem

The purpose of this project is to refine my front-end skilss utilizing Coder Coder Youtube Videos. 

Prior to this, I had been building the front-end of my projects with ids more than classes. As I watch Coder Coder..well code I have a better understanding of the proper syntax of SCSS. 


That being said, I had a hard time with understanding media queries prior. Coder Coder easily elaborates on her process in building the front end mentor landing page to it is easy to dissct the information. 


DAY1: Learned about SCSS, created the site with the intention of it being mobile first. Lastly, used semantic HTML.
